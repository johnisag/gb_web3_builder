# Local Testing

This tutorial should familiarize you with starting a local blockchain using Hardhat, deploying a sample smart contract to the local blockchain and interacting with that blockchain with Metamask and Remix.

#### Why local blockchain?

* It is very useful to run a local blockchain because testing becomes very fast and efficient.&#x20;
* It is only your machine which is running the blockchain and thus consensus is fast and you dont have to wait for other nodes to sync or validate.&#x20;
* You can also use many specialized modules specially built for local testing like [Hardhat console.log](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/debugging-with-hardhat-network.html) which helps you to add printing inside your contract.

### Build

To build the smart contract we would be using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

* Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development in Solidity
*   &#x20;You can write your smart contract, deploy them, run tests, and debug your code.
