# NFT and IFPS

### Requirements

* There should only exist 10 LearnWeb3 Punk NFT's and each one of them should be unique.
* User's should be able to mint only 1 NFT with one transaction.
* The metadata for the NFT's should be stored on IPFS
* There should be a website for your NFT Collection.
* The NFT contract should be deployed on Mumbai testnet

### IPFS

First, we need to upload our images and metadata on to IPFS.&#x20;

We'll use a service called [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) which will help us upload and pin content on IPFS. Once you've signed up, go to the [Pinata Dashboard](https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager) and click on 'Upload' and then on 'Folder'.

Download [the LW3Punks folder](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/IPFS-Practical/tree/master/my-app/public/LW3punks) to your computer and then upload to it `Pinata`, name the folder `LW3Punks`

Now you should be able to see a `CID` for your folder
