# Using Ceramic Network

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Ceramic is a decentralized data network, that allows for building composable Web3 applications.
* Ceramic decentralizes application databases,&#x20;
* Application developers can reuse data across applications and make them automatically interoperable.

### Web3 and Data

In the past few years, we have seen Web3 trends like DeFi, NFTs, and more recently DAOs blow up.

Smart contract platforms like Ethereum have shown us that dApps which act as legos, and can be composed together with other dApps to build entirely new dApps have a lot of value.

This is particularly highlighted with tokens that build on top of other tokens, DeFi protocols which utilize other DeFi protocols, etc.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Ceramic allows you to bring that same type of composability to data on the internet. This can be any kind of data. Profiles, social connections, blog posts, identities, reputation, game assets, etc.**</mark>

This is an abstract concept, and it is a bit tricky to try and define Ceramic Network as a single thing.

Similar to Ethereum, which by itself is hard to define (what does it even mean to be a smart contract plaform?), it is easier to understand if we look at specific use cases that Ceramic can enable and examples of a vision for the future.

Ethereum is much easier to understand when we look at exact examples like DeFi protocols, NFTs, DAOs etc - the same thinking can be applied while attempting to understand Ceramic.

### Lack of data in Web3

**The web3 market** right now is mainly comprised of financial applications.&#x20;

* Things to do with tokens and digital assets.
* &#x20;This is somewhat due to design.&#x20;
* Smart contracts are inherently limited in how much data can be stored in them, and there's only so much data functionality that can be built.

As we progress and dApps mature, the market demand for building more data-rich applications is increasing.&#x20;

Trends like decentralized social medias, decentralized reputation platforms, decentralized blogs, etc. is taking off, with a lot of technical approaches being taken, but lacking in one aspect or the other.

**In Web2**, these platforms were built as data silos.&#x20;

* Your Twitter posts and social connections are locked into the Twitter platform - you cannot transfer your social connections on Twitter to Facebook, you cannot transfer your Twitter posts to Facebook, etc.&#x20;
* They are all built as silos.

<mark style="color:purple;">**This will change. Ceramic is betting on interoperable applications and interoperable ecosystems being able to outcompete these siloed platforms.**</mark>

### So... What does Ceramic do?

Ceramic is building:

1. A generalized data protocol
2. where data can be modified only by the owner
3. with high volume data processing
4. with global data availability and consistency
5. with support for fast querying
6. with interoperable data across applications
7. and community governance

This is a lot. This is also why Ceramic can be tricky to define on it's own. After all, just like Ethereum, it is a generalized protocol, albeit for data.

To achieve the true scale and vision of Ceramic, a lot of breakthroughs need to be achieved.&#x20;

* If Ceramic is to become the decentralized database of the web, it **needs to be able to scale massively** - more than any centralized database today as none of them are storing data from the entire internet.
* **Data also needs to be made globally available**
* It needs to be ensured that **Ceramic node runners make that data available** for the rest of the world and **don't hijack it**.
* Ceramic also needs to be **fast to query and retrieve data from**
  * Users typically read much more data than they write, so fast reads and queries are extremely important for Ceramic to work at scale.
* All of this while **maintaining a high level of security and privacy** over data, and ensuring that it doesn't come crashing down one day.

It is helpful to look at specific use cases that can be enabled by Ceramic today and the benefits of having a mutable, decentralized, general purpose data protocol.
